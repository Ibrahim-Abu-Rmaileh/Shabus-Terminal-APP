Bus Terminal application for Shabus -  Cooperative Transportation Association of Jerusalem

In every Shabus bus there is a Tablet (or any other smart the device). This Smart device was used as some sort of Terminal for the driver and the Bus Clients<br/>
<b>Our application is the Beating heart of this "Terminal".</b><br/>
The application will escort the driver and the Clients all over the night shift until the bus will return the party people and the driver home safely :>
